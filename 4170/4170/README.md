Build the code by running make

Run problem 1 by executing ./problem1
Complexity is O(value * number of coins)
The program is memoized, memory usage scales with value and number of coins
The answer is 120536

Run problem 2 by executing ./problem2
The complexity is O(highest roll * number of dice^2)
The answer is 0.637

Run problem 3 by executing ./problem3 < input.txt
The complexity is O(n^3)
unfortunately I was not able to finish my implementation, but my current answer is 12519
